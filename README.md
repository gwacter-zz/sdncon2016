#SDNCON 2016
## A hands-on, network engineering meeting

We are pleased to announce a hands-on, network engineering meeting to be held 7th and 8th July at Victoria University.

We will be starting around 9.30am on the 7th of July. 

This event is for anyone who wants to gain experience in developing software defined network applications that run on 
real hardware (in particular the Zodiac FX OpenFlow switch).

We will be using the Ryu controller framework so you should have some basic knowledge of Python programming. 

We will also be using the Faucet controller and will post resources to learning about this before the event.

The idea is to either demonstrate the use of Faucet with some use cases, build a SDN application on top of Faucet or extend Faucet functionality. We encourage the use of unit tests as this is a key feature of Faucet.

We have will have mentors circulating on the day who can give advice and we expect that teams can help each other. There are some prizes but the focus for the day is friendly competition where we learn from each other.

On the Friday afternoon we will have Show and Tells from the teams and close with more pizza
