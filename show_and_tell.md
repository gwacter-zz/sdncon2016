# Show and Tell

After lunch on Friday we will have presentations from the teams. 

Depending upon the number of teams we expect that each presentation should be about 15 minutes.

You should briefly set the scene for what you have done, demonstrate it and summarise any lessons learnt 
(in particular, what improvements to the technical tools).

Presentations will be in the room used for the hackathon, we have an AV setup with flying cables for laptops. 

Afterwards our esteemed judges (mentors + sponsors) will convene to determine prizes.

*It would be a good idea to bring any adaptors for VGA that you might have*.

We'll put together a running order on Friday morning and publish it below.
