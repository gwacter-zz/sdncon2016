# Hardware on the day

We have providing *SEVEN* pre-built development testbeds built around Raspberry PIs and Zodiac FX switches. 

We will also have some other equipment but we strongly suggest that you use our pre-built environment. Depending upon numbers of people on the day, we may suggest individual participants combine together into a team to share a testbed.
